    "# Simulated Annealing to find the optimal observing schedule for optical follow-up observations from LIGO\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook employs simulated annealing, in order to optimize the observing schedule for (in this case) optical follow-up observations of LIGO GW-data. We are doing the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Import all necessary libraries & define some constants\n",
    "- Define all functions\n",
    "- start the simulated annealing and determine the optimal schedule\n",
    "\n",
    "The general idea is to minimize \"energy\" of a boltzman-statistical energy probability distribution function: $$p(E_j) \\propto \\exp\\left(-\\frac{E_j-E_i}{c\\cdot T}\\right)$$In our case we want to minimize the observing time. We therefore start with an observing plan and iteratively change it (\"atomic change\", i.e. swap two rows). Within each iteration we calculate the \"energy\" of the new plan and if the energy and therefore an energy dependant acceptance probability is higher than a random number, we continue with the new observing schedule. By lowering the temperature we find with an increasing probability the minimal energy state, i.e. the best observing plan"
