# LIGO DESI GW Follow Up

## Description
In collaboration between the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Carnegie Mellon University, and LMU, we are planning a follow-up campaign of O4 LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA events with the 2m telescope at Wendelstein Observatory. The scope is two-fold. First, we plan to record extended nightly lightcurves of known or suspected counterparts in the optical and near-infrared using the Wide-Field and Three-Channel Imager. Second, with higher risk and potential gain, we plan to search for counterparts in cases where the 3D localization of the event leads to a short list of likely hosts among the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts already observed by DESI across much of the northern sky. Here I will present our plans and current status and welcome input by ORIGINS colleagues on what may be the most valuable strategies for follow-up.
## Roadmap
If you have ideas for releases in the future, it is a good idea to list them in the README.
